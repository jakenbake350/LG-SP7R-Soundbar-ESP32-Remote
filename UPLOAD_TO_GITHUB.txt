# How to Upload This Project to GitHub

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `LG-SPD7R-ESP32-Remote`
3. Description: `Custom IR remote for LG SPD7R soundbar using ESP32`
4. Choose "Public" (so others can find the IR codes)
5. DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Link and Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\jaket\ESP-32\SoundBarRemote2"

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/jakenbake350/LG-SPD7R-ESP32-Remote.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

When prompted for credentials:
- Username: jakenbake350
- Password: Use a Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

### To create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "ESP32 Remote Upload"
4. Check the "repo" checkbox (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
6. COPY THE TOKEN - you won't see it again!
7. Use this token as your password when git asks

## Step 3: Verify Upload

Go to https://github.com/jakenbake350/LG-SPD7R-ESP32-Remote and you should see all your files!

## Alternative: GitHub Desktop (Easier!)

If you prefer a GUI:
1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. File → Add Local Repository
4. Choose: C:\Users\jaket\ESP-32\SoundBarRemote2
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Make sure it's PUBLIC
7. Click "Publish repository"

Done!
